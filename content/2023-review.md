It's almost 2024, so everyone should harvest something in 2023 :)

- In 2023, I have gone from being a pragmatic open-source software lover to a free software enthusiast. The ROM on my [Android](https://www.android.com) phone was switched from [MIUI](https://home.miui.com) which is the  stock firmware on my phone, to the AOSP-based [crDroid](https://crdroid.net). I was struggling to use as little proprietary software as possible both on my phone and PC, minimizing my dependence on proprietary network services.

- In February, I [joined the FSF](https://my.fsf.org/join) by paying $5 membership fee on a monthly basis. When I discover a nice free software on [Github](https://github.com), if the developer has set up [Github Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors), I will probably financially support him/her (individual FOSS developers will be given $1 or $2 per month).

- In March, I submitted my [archlinuxcn](https://github.com/archlinuxcn) maintainer application to [@lilydjwg](https://github.com/lilydjwg) who is one of the founders of [archlinuxcn](https://github.com/archlinuxcn) via email, and became an [archlinuxcn](https://github.com/archlinuxcn) maintainer. In the following 9 months, I committed more than 900 times (initially I was unfamiliar with [lilac](https://github.com/archlinuxcn/lilac) hence made a few mistakes).

- Due to the poor battery life and hardship of portability with the peripherals of [ROG Zephyrus M16](https://rog.asus.com/laptops/rog-zephyrus/2021-rog-zephyrus-m16-series), I purchased a [chromebook](https://www.google.com/chromebook) at the end of March. After trying [ChromeOS](https://www.google.com/chromebook/chrome-os) for several hours, I flashed [coreboot](https://coreboot.org) and installed [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) on it (it's my first experience of an x86 PC with open-source UEFI firmware). Now I take this [chromebook](https://www.google.com/chromebook) with me when I go out, which is very portable weighing 1.3 kg. Instead of turning it off, most of the time I close the lid to make it suspend.

- In May, I found a [Tauri](https://tauri.app)-based and [GPL-licensed](https://github.com/pot-app/pot-desktop/blob/master/LICENSE) translation application on [Github](https://github.com) (namely [pot-desktop](https://github.com/pot-app/pot-desktop)). Nonetheless, after installing it from [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pot-translation), I realized its [Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org) support is inferior. Therefore, I gave feedback to [the developer](https://github.com/Pylogmon), and soon the [Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org) support became immaculate. The updated version of [pot-desktop](https://github.com/pot-app/pot-desktop) added support for OCR and [plugin functionality](https://github.com/pot-app/pot-app-translate-plugin-template), thus I participated in the development of [its plugins](https://github.com/pot-app/pot-app-plugin-list).

- In June, I joined [PLCT](https://plctlab.github.io) and worked as an [openEuler](https://www.openeuler.org) packaging intern for 3 months, but I found this position was not suitable for me as I disliked [openEuler](https://www.openeuler.org) which is totally a product of "Information Technology Application Innovation" in China. Furthermore, its ```init``` system, [sysmaster](http://sysmaster.online), is entirely a pointless refactoring product of [systemd](https://systemd.io).

- In July, I participated in [LLUG (Linux Lovers User Group) in Shanghai](https://linux.cn/article-16017-1.html), and met several friends with whom I get acquainted in the [Arch Linux Chinese Community](https://www.archlinuxcn.org). In a 5-minute lightning talk, I shared my experience from a Linux novice to an [archlinuxcn](https://github.com/archlinuxcn) maintainer.

- In September, I attended [the Software Freedom Day hosted by USTC (University of Science and Technology of China)](https://lug.ustc.edu.cn/news/2023/09/SFD) online by means of [Jitsi Meet](https://jitsi.member.fsf.org), and delivered a speech centered around FOSS. During my presentation, I shared my experience in the open source community, introduced the notion of free software and recommended notable free software including [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org) and [Matrix](https://matrix.org). Additionally, I got to meet some free software enthusiasts in [USTC](https://en.ustc.edu.cn).

- Since [the bug](https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=474805) I reported to [Ark](https://apps.kde.org/ark) (the archive software of [KDE](https://kde.org)) in September was not fixed in several weeks, I took the initiative to fix it myself and submitted my first merge request to [KDE](https://kde.org) in October. From then on, I have been learning [Qt](https://www.qt.io) and [Kirigami](https://develop.kde.org/frameworks/kirigami) and trying to fix simple bugs in [KDE](https://kde.org) software (not capable of fixing the complex ones at all yet)

- Overall, I had some regrets but also quite a few gains in 2023. Hankering for a more wonderful 2024 :)

- Last but not least, happy new year!
